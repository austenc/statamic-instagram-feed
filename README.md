### This version of the addon is only for Statamic 3+

_This is a premium addon which adds a fieldtype which gets images from instagram profiles.
The addon is proprietary software, please buy a license on the Statamic marketplace to use it. Thank you_!

**For example:**

```
{{ instagram_feed limit="3" }}
    <img src="{{ image }}">
{{ /instagram_feed }}
```

## Requirements

- Statamic 3
- Instagram credentials for an account with Multi-factor auth turned OFF

## Installation

Require the package with composer:

```
composer require austenc/statamic-instagram-feed
```

## Configuration

You need to configure an Instagram username and password. Optionally, you can
include a different profile for the feed to display.

Set the username/password `.env` file

```sh
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME='your-username'
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD='your-password'
INSTAGRAM_PROFILE='other-profile' # defaults to your username
```

> The username and password do not have to match the profile displayed, as long as the account can view the profile.

## Usage

After configuring your Instagram username and password, use the `{{ instagram_feed }}` tag:

```
{{ instagram_feed }}
    <img src="{{ image }}">
{{ /instagram_feed }}
```

> You may also use the `limit` parameter to restrict the number of recent posts

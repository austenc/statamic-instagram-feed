# Instagram Feed for Statamic ![Statamic 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/statamic-2-blue.svg?style=flat-square)

ðŸ“¸ **Easily embed photos from a public instagram feed** ðŸ“¸

This addon adds a fieldtype which gets images from public instagram profiles.

For example:
```
{{ instagram_feed limit="3" }}
    <img src="{{ image }}">
{{ /instagram_feed }}
```

## Installation

1. Copy the `addons/InstagramFeed` directory to your project's `site/addons` folder. 
2. Run `php please update:addons`
3. Enter your Instagram username in the control panel, or by creating a file at `site/settings/addons/instagram_feed.yaml` with the following:
```
username: 'your-instagram-username'
```

Note that your profile **must be public** for this to work. 

## Usage
After configuring your Instagram username, simply use the `{{ instagram_feed }}` 
tag like so:
```
{{ instagram_feed }}
    <img src="{{ image }}">
{{ /instagram_feed }}
```
> You may also use the `limit` parameter to restrict the number of recent posts
